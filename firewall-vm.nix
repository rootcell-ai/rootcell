# Firewall VM: a tiny appliance VM that brokers all egress for the agent VM.
#
# Two NICs:
#   enp0s1  vzNAT       — internet egress (default route)
#   lima0   lima:host   — private link to the agent VM (default
#                          192.168.106.0/24, overridable via .env;
#                          IPs come from network.nix)
#
# Hybrid filtering — HTTPS is transparent, SSH is explicit:
#
#   HTTPS/HTTP traffic from the agent VM is intercepted by nftables NAT
#   PREROUTING REDIRECT (TCP 80, 443 → local :8081), so the agent VM's
#   `curl https://github.com` works without any proxy env vars. mitmproxy
#   in transparent mode reads the original destination via SO_ORIGINAL_DST
#   and the SNI from the TLS ClientHello, then either kills the connection
#   (deny) or relays raw bytes (allow — no MITM).
#
#   SSH is explicit. The agent VM's `programs.ssh.matchBlocks` (in home.nix)
#   sets a ProxyCommand that opens an HTTP CONNECT tunnel to mitmproxy
#   running in regular mode on :8080. mitmproxy's addon allowlists by
#   CONNECT host:22.
#
#   DNS is explicit too — the agent VM's networkConfig.DNS points at the
#   firewall directly. dnsmasq forwards allowlisted suffixes to 1.1.1.1;
#   everything else returns 0.0.0.0.
#
# Why two mitmproxy instances? mitmproxy listens in one mode at a time —
# transparent expects raw redirected TCP, regular expects HTTP CONNECT.
# Both use the same addon (Python file), but separate sockets and modes.
#
# Why no IP forwarding? With ip_forward=0 the kernel refuses to forward
# packets at all. The NAT REDIRECT path doesn't need forwarding because
# DNAT rewrites the destination to local before the routing decision —
# packets land in INPUT, not FORWARD. Any TCP traffic that doesn't match
# the REDIRECT rule (e.g., agent's direct attempt to github.com:22) gets
# dropped because there's no route. Belt-and-suspenders against any
# escape via unredirected ports.
#
# Allowlists are mutable runtime files (NOT Nix-store) so `./agent allow`
# can hot-reload them without a guest rebuild.
