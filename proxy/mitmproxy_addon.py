"""TLS-intercepting allowlist addon for mitmproxy.

Used by two mitmproxy instances on the firewall VM:

  * regular mode (port 8080) — receives explicit HTTP CONNECT from the
    agent VM's SSH ProxyCommand. http_connect inspects the CONNECT host
    against allowed-ssh.txt for port 22.

  * transparent mode (port 8081) — receives nftables-redirected raw TCP
    for port 443. tls_clienthello inspects the SNI from the TLS
    ClientHello against allowed-https.txt; if allowed, mitmproxy
    terminates TLS using our per-deployment CA and opens a NEW TLS
    connection upstream, validating the upstream cert against the SNI.
    The request hook then enforces that the HTTP Host header agrees
    with the SNI of the connection it arrived on.

Why full MITM (was: SNI passthrough): SNI alone doesn't bind the bytes
to the upstream identity. A cooperating client could send
SNI=allowlisted.com but route the TCP to attacker IP, and `curl -k`
(or any client tolerating cert errors) would happily establish a
clean tunnel. With MITM, mitmproxy is the TLS *client* upstream and
validates the upstream cert against the SNI/Host — the attacker IP
can't produce a valid allowlisted.com cert, so the upstream
connection fails and no bytes flow.

Cleartext HTTP is NOT allowlisted. The HTTP `Host` header is
unauthenticated for plaintext connections, AND port 80 is not
NAT-redirected (see firewall-vm.nix), so the request hook never
fires for plain HTTP in normal operation. The deny-all in `request`
for non-TLS flows is defense-in-depth in case any client ever sends
a plain HTTP request to either listener.

The CA private key never leaves the firewall VM (loaded via systemd
LoadCredential into a tmpfs readable only by the mitmproxy service
uid). The agent VM's system trust store includes the CA's public
cert via security.pki.certificateFiles — that's what makes the
minted per-host certs verify.

Allowlists live in /etc/agent-vm/ on the firewall VM. The addon stats
them on every event and reloads on mtime change, so `./rootcell allow`
takes effect with no service restart.
